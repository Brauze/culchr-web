# Culchr Event Management System - Enhanced Development Guide

## System Architecture Overview

Culchr is a comprehensive festival management platform that bridges physical RFID bracelets with digital ticketing, payments, and vendor management. The enhanced system now includes multi-language support, accessibility features, social integration, advanced analytics, and real-time capabilities.

### Core User Types & Portals
1. Customers: Ticket purchasing, wallet management, bracelet linking, social sharing
2. Event Organizers: Event creation, ticket sales, analytics, commission tracking, staff management
3. Vendors: Product sales, inventory, withdrawal management, real-time updates
4. Admins: System oversight, user management, financial reconciliation, security monitoring
5. Public: Event discovery, social sharing, and ticket purchasing interface
6. Staff/Volunteers: Shift management, emergency protocols, customer support

### Enhanced Technology Stack
- Backend: Flask (Python) with SQLAlchemy ORM, WebSocket support
- Frontend: HTMX + Bootstrap 5 (reactive, accessible UI with WCAG compliance)
- Database: Mysql with advanced indexing and partitioning
- Cache: Redis for sessions, real-time data, and performance
- Queue: Celery for background tasks and notifications
- Payments: Mtnmomo + airtelmoney + Flutterwave SDK + Multi-currency + Escrow services
- Security: JWT tokens, 2FA, biometric auth, bcrypt, RBAC
- Internationalization: Flask-Babel for multi-language support
- Real-time: WebSocket implementation for live updates
- Analytics: Advanced predictive analytics and BI dashboard
- Mobile: API endpoints for iOS/Android apps
